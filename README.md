# first_app

An app that asks you 2 questions

## What it does

This app asks the user to answer two simple questions:

- `Where do you live?`
- `What pet do you have?`

After the user answers it presents a quick summary of the questionare and allows the user to re-take the quiz.

## What I learned

In this first touch with flutter I practiced custom widgets, conditional rendering in dart, stateless and statefull widgets and overall State management
